Of course, Freebia is thriving to this day.However, very few events necessitate being added to this history page. For a more complete record of activity within Freebia, investigate the news page, which will allow you to trace the Empire's history back as far as you could possibly want and to a level of detail most find impenetrable and agonizing.<P>

The Imperial history continues today...<P>
