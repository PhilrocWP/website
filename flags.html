The Freebian flag is one of the most unique flags in the world since not many nations have a flag with the colours of blue red & green together with a yellow star in the centre.the Freebian flag contains the green for the land. the red for Freebia's people. The blue is for the water in the ocean. as the yellow lines between the 3 layers has no official meaning, and the star means the president, Zakkary Graham.<br>
